Spatial 3D videos for the Apple Vision Pro

## About
These are spatial 3D videos designed for the Apple Vision Pro converted from the example videos produced by OpenAI's Sora video generator: https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators

## How to watch the videos on an Apple Vision Pro
### Via direct download on Apple Vision Pro
1. Click and hold on a video link until you get a menu.
2. Download from the menu.
3. Open your files folder and watch.

### Via AirDrop
1. Download the videos to an iPhone or Mac.
2. AirDrop a video to a nearby Apple Vision Pro.
3. Watch!

## Method
I created two video tracks, one for the left eye and one for the right and slightly shifted the timing of the tracks based upon the direction of the movement of the video. This creates a simulated stereoscopic 3D effect and only works with video where there is sideways motion.

To convert the video into the Apple Spatial video format I used Mike Swansons CLI tool: https://blog.mikeswanson.com/spatial
